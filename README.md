# covid-classification
T1(it only gives correct results if we upload both image and its mask(we can also use t2 for generating that)): a deep learning classifier that takes an x-ray image as the input and
assigns the input image to one of the four classes: COVID-19 positive, Normal, Lung Opacity, Viral Pneumonia.

T2(okay but needs to get optimized): an image segmentation network to segment the left and right lungs from the x-ray images.
